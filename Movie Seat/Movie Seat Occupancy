       7 

create table movie_seats
(
seat_no int,
occupant_gender varchar(2)
);

insert into movie_seats values(1,'F');
insert into movie_seats values(2,'M');
insert into movie_seats values(3,'M');
insert into movie_seats values(4,'F');

Solution Code : 
with cte_grouped_male_occupant as 
(
select *,
seat_no-row_number() over(partition by occupant_gender order by seat_no) as seat_grp
from movie_seats
where occupant_gender='M'
),
cte_consecutive_seat_count as
(
select seat_grp,count(seat_no) as seat_no_cnt
from cte_grouped_male_occupant
group by seat_grp
having count(seat_no)>=3
)
select o.seat_no
from cte_grouped_male_occupant o
inner join
cte_consecutive_seat_count c
on o.seat_grp=c.seat_grp
